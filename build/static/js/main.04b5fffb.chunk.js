They\u2019re now seeking $1.5 million each and an injunction preventing continued discrimination from the department."},{"p":"Their case\u2019s defendants include Baker, Johnson and university President Wallace Loh.

And less than a month before Collins was stabbed, a noose was found hanging in a fraternity house."},{"p":"In the wake of Collins\u2019 slaying, the administration launched a campus diversity task force, hired a hate bias response program manager and commissioned an external review of inclusion measures.
