          This story is an in-depth feature on two electricians — DuRay Jones
          and Michael Bell — who are suing UMD for racial discrimination.
        </p>

        <p>
          They filed their lawsuit in federal court last summer, but besides an
          initial story with the basic facts from the court documents, no one
          has really reported on what drove them to file or what the process has been like for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project is both a close look at their case and a narrative about
          how the stress of it has affected their home lives and mental health.
